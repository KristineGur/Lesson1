      >
      is a 1997 Italian comedy drama film directed by and starring
      <a href="contact.html">Roberto Benigni</a>, who co-wrote the film with
      Vincenzo Cerami. Benigni plays Guido Orefice, a Jewish Italian bookshop
      owner, who employs his fertile imagination to shield his son from the
      horrors of internment in a Nazi concentration camp. The film was partially
      inspired by the book In the End, I Beat Hitler by Rubino Romeo Salmon√¨ and
      by Benigni's father, who spent two years in the Bergen-Belsen
      concentration camp during World War II.
